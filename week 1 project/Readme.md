# Week 1 Project
**Imagine you're working with Sprint, one of the biggest telecom companies in the USA. They're really keen on figuring out how many customers might decide to leave them in the coming months. Luckily, they've got a bunch of past data about when customers have left before, as well as info about who these customers are, what they've bought, and other things like that.

So, if you were in charge of predicting customer churn how would you go about using machine learning to make a good guess about which customers might leave? Like, what steps would you take to create a machine learning model that can predict if someone's going to leave or not?**

## Step 1: Data Collection 
Collect historical data about customer churn, including features like customer demographics, usage patterns, contract details,
customer support interactions, etc. For instance, this could include information about contract length, monthly spending, 
customer tenure, service usage, etc. Gather data from Sprint's databases, such as customer profiles, billing information, 
call and data usage logs, and customer service interactions.
## Step 2 Data Processing and Cleaning
Use Pandas to Clean and peocess the Data

import pandas as pd

### Assuming you have a CSV file containing customer data
data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')

## Step 3 Data Preprocessing 
Clean the data (handle missing values, outliers, etc.)
data = data.dropna()  

### Remove rows with missing values
data = data[data['monthly_spending'] > 0]  # Remove outliers with negative spending

## Step 4: Feature Selection and Engineering
Identify relevant features that might influence churn. For example, consider including features like contract length,
 monthly spending, customer tenure, service usage, and customer satisfaction scores.

### Example: Consider contract length, monthly spending, tenure, and usage patterns as features
selected_features = ['contract_length', 'monthly_spending', 'tenure', 'usage_patterns']
X = data[selected_features]
y = data['churn']  # Assuming 'churn' is the label indicating whether a customer has churned or not

### Split Data Divide the data into training and testing sets. This ensures you can evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

## Step 5: Select Model 
### Consider various machine learning models suitable for classification tasks. For example, start with a Random Forest Classifier, which is known for its ability to handle complex relationships in data.
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model = RandomForestClassifier()

## Step 6: Model Training
### Train the selected model on the training data. The model learns the patterns in the data to make predictions.
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

## Step 7: Model Evaluation
### Use the test data to evaluate the model's performance. Consider metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy}')
print(f'Classification Report:\n{report}')

### Model Optimization and Hyperparameter Tuning
 Example: Perform Grid Search for hyperparameter tuning
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 5, 10],
}

grid_search = GridSearchCV(model, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

best_model = grid_search.best_estimator_

## Step 8: Model Interpretability (Optional)
### Example: Using SHAP values for feature importance
import shap

explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(best_model)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X_test)

shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)

## Step 9: Deployment
 Deploy the model using a suitable framework or platform (e.g., Flask, AWS Lambda, etc.)

## Step 10: Monitoring and Maintenance
 Regularly monitor model performance and retrain as needed
 Continuously gather feedback from stakeholders and customer support teams for model improvement.
